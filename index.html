           <p class="text">We are backbone behind startups presenting as ventures are usually associated with design science. Design science uses design principles considered to be a coherent set of normative ideas and propositions to design and construct the company backbone. For example, one of the initial design principles in effectuate is "affordable loss". It's better to first make a must-have for a small number of users (early adopters) than a nice-to-have for a large number of users. It is much easier to get more users than to go from nice-to-have to must-have.Because of the lack of information, high uncertainty, the need to make decisions quickly, founders of startups use lots of heuristics and exhibit biases in their startup actions.</p>

                    <p>Hashtag campaigns like #shareacoke are a popular way to get customers engaged, but don’t always elicit feedback you can apply into your business. A smarter hashtag approach for customer and client feedback is the Twitter Chat, where customers are invited to attend a virtual gathering to express their opinions and ask questions on a given topic. These generate valuable insight quickly and cost-effectively.</p><br>

                    <p>The polling capability of social platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been maturing fast. There’s even an established ecosystem of complementary applications out there to help collate and visualise data. And while many of the questions asked are seemingly superficial and ‘just for fun’, smart operators are finding ways of discovering how their products are used and ranked.</p><br>
